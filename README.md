### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marius Christensen, welcome to my GitHub!

Currently studying Front-End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media while trying to juggle the life with a new baby

So far i'm loving development, wish I had more time to really dive deep into it, but in time i'll make it happen. 

Currently somewhat competent with HTML & CSS, getting more comfortable with Javascript, looking forward for more challenges the next year. 

- Finally seem to figure out what i wanna be when i'm grown up (better late than never?)
- I love watching discs fly through the air
- I never sleep anymore (babies are pretty cool otherwise tho)
