### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marius Christensen, welcome to my GitHub!

Currently learning Front-End Development at Kodehode

So far i'm loving it!

Currently somewhat competent with HTML & CSS, getting more comfortable with Javascript, looking forward for more challenges the next year. 

- Finally seem to figure out what i wanna be when i'm grown up (better late than never?)
- I love watching discs fly through the air
- I never sleep anymore (babies are pretty cool otherwise tho)
