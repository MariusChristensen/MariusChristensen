# Hi, I’m Marius!  
I code things, break things, fix things, repeat.

## About Me

Hey there! I’m Marius Christensen, a passionate front-end developer currently sharpening my skills through Kodehode and personal projects.  

I’m comfortable with HTML & CSS, having moved into the world of JavaScript, React, and API integrations.  
I love building things from scratch and watching them (sometimes) work!

My learning journey is still ongoing, and I’m enjoying every frustrating, rewarding, and head-scratching minute of it.

## Currently Exploring

- React Native (because why stop at web?)
- Building full-stack hobby projects
- Working with REST APIs & async data
- Mastering the art of "why doesn’t this work?"

## A Few Fun Facts

-  I love disc golf and watching discs fly (hopefully not into trees)
-  I run entirely on caffeine and baby giggles (my sleep schedule is… creative)
-  I enjoy figuring things out the hard way so you don’t have to

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open for collaboration, learning new stuff, and chatting about front-end dev, disc golf, or how to survive on no sleep.
