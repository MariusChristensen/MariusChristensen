# Hi, I’m Marius!  
I code things, break things, fix things, repeat.

## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I’m Marius Christensen, a passionate front-end developer currently sharpening my skills through Kodehode and personal projects.  

I’m comfortable with HTML & CSS, having moved into the world of JavaScript, React, and API integrations.  
I love building things from scratch and watching them (sometimes) work!

My learning journey is still ongoing, and I’m enjoying every frustrating, rewarding, and head-scratching minute of it.
